- lack of concept of time in CASAL2 mortality blocks. Because CASAL2 lacks a concept of time in its constant mortality block, the user has to provide an amount of mortality (instead of a rate) affecting fish during the period because CASAL2 will not multiply this entry by the proportion of the duration of year this mortality is applied to. An example will clarify this concept: suppose you create a model defining 3 periods during the year (Jan-Apr; May-Aug and Sep-Dec). CASAL2 does not associate a duration of a 1/3 of a year to these periods. Suppose you want to apply a natural mortality rate of 0.4 per year using a mortality_constant_rate type of process to the first and the last period, reserving the middle one for fishing mortality, you'll have to enter in the block of instruction corresponding to the natural mortality process a value of 0.2 for m. In other words value of m in a process mortality_constant_rate are not rates, they are absolute values (quantities without units obtained from multiplying a rate by time).

- calculation of initial value using the iterative approach assumes that the stock model in CASAL2 is not exploited before the beginning of the time series of catches (in a virgin state). If this is not the case, the iterative method to calculate the initial numbers in the population for CASAL2 to work from will be erroneous because the initialisation method assumes only natural mortality remove individuals from the population in the year preceeding those in the model.

- the pulse removals fishery model (which assumes catches are removed instantaneously) removes a proportion of the stock (0 <= U <= 1). Because CASAL2 has not concept of time, the fishery removal can be equated to (1-exp(-F)) which provides the relationship between the proportion of the stock removed and fishing mortality: U = 1-exp(-F) or F = -log(1-U) (see Hilborn and Walters, Quantitative Fisheries Stock Assessment,1992, p.352)
