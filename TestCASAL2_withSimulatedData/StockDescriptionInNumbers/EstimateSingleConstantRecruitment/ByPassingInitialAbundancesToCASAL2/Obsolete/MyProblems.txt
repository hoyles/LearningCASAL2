Hi Craig,


- conceptual model in R

 1. recruitment happen at the beginning of the time interval
 2. constant M and F over the interval is used to calculate death by fishing and natural causes
 3. at the end of the interval, ageing move all fish alive to the next age group.
 
I'd like to use to estimate parameters (recruitment, natural mortality, etc...). I am using simulated data of a single species, single area, with constant natural mortality.
